Bugs
----

* Behaviour of __eq__ with objects of other non-compatible types should
  be examined.  Same with __lt__, etc.

* Special methods aren't correctly returning NotImplemented.


Documentation
-------------

* Create some!


Features
--------

* Better package name!

* Infix operators should use the 'preferredWidth' attribute to decide which
  output format to use.  (In general, Python special methods need work.)

* Add tests for the following operations that are implemented but not
  supported by standard tests:

     comparisons

* Implement flags and flag operations.

* Look at the rest of the recommended functionality (e.g., correctly-rounded
  math operations; could take some time!)

* Expose 'encode' and 'decode' as suitable methods.  (It's odd that the
  specification doesn't recommend methods for encoding binary floats.)  They
  should encode to and from integers, as those are the closest thing we have to
  bit strings in pure Python.

* Define the conversionSpecification type properly.

* convertToHexCharacter should get the same treatment for conversion
  specifications as convertToDecimalCharacter.

* Ensure that we always return unicode strings from convertToHexCharacter and convertToDecimalCharacter.

* Use enumerated type of some form for number classes.


Internal refactoring
--------------------


Performance
-----------

* Optimize addition / subtraction / fused-multiply-add for cases where
  exponents differ wildly.

* Properties on the BinaryInterchangeFormat should be cached.
