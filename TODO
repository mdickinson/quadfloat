Bugs
----

* Behaviour of __eq__ with objects of other non-compatible types should
  be examined.  Same with __lt__, etc.

* Special methods aren't correctly returning NotImplemented.

* Lots of public methods are missing docstrings.

* Missing documentation.


Documentation
-------------

* Create some!


Features
--------

* __repr__ should be changed to include the hex representation instead
  of the Decimal representation.

* The non formatOf operations should be exposed as functions, as well as or
  instead of as methods.  It's more natural to do remainder(x, y) than
  x.remainder(y).

* Similarly, the formatOf operations should be exposed as methods (or in the
  usual way as infix operators) that use the 'preferredWidth' attribute to
  decide which format to use.

* Fill out the rest of the IEEE 754 *required* operations.

* Implement flags.

* Look at the rest of the recommended functionality (e.g., correctly-rounded
  math operations; could take some time!)


Internal refactoring
--------------------

* Be consistent about internal uses of is_finite, is_infinite versus ._type
  tests.


Performance
-----------

* Optimize addition / subtraction / fused-multiply-add for cases where
  exponents differ wildly.

* Properties on the BinaryInterchangeFormat should be cached.
