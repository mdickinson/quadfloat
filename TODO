Bugs
----

* Behaviour of __eq__ with objects of other non-compatible types should
  be examined.  Same with __lt__, etc.

* Special methods aren't correctly returning NotImplemented.

* Lots of public methods are missing docstrings.

* Missing documentation.


Documentation
-------------

* Create some!


Features
--------

* __repr__ should be changed to include the hex representation instead
  of the Decimal representation.

* Infix operators should use the 'preferredWidth' attribute to decide which
  output format to use.

* Fill out the rest of the IEEE 754 *required* operations.  Right now, that's:

    convertToDecimalCharacter

* Also, add tests for the following operations that are implemented but not
  supported by standard tests:

     comparisons

* Implement flags and flag operations.

* Look at the rest of the recommended functionality (e.g., correctly-rounded
  math operations; could take some time!)


Internal refactoring
--------------------

* In _rich_compare_general and similar methods, use the standard methods
  convertFormat, convertFromInteger instead of _from_int, _from_binary_float.
  Remove the need for the 'inexact' return by using a directed rounding mode
  and inspecting flags.


Performance
-----------

* Optimize addition / subtraction / fused-multiply-add for cases where
  exponents differ wildly.

* Properties on the BinaryInterchangeFormat should be cached.
