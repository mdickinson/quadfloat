Bugs
----

* Behaviour of __eq__ with objects of other non-compatible types should
  be examined.  Same with __lt__, etc.

* Special methods aren't correctly returning NotImplemented.

* Lots of public methods are missing docstrings.

* Missing documentation.


Documentation
-------------

* Create some!


Features
--------

* Fill out the rest of the IEEE 754 *required* operations.

* Implement flags.

* Look at the rest of the recommended functionality (e.g., correctly-rounded
  math operations; could take some time!)

* Support earlier versions of Python (e.g., 3.1, 2.5) in addition to the current
  versions (>= 2.6, >= 3.2).


Internal refactoring
--------------------

* Remove dependence on decimal.

* Be consistent about internal uses of is_finite, is_infinite versus ._type
  tests.


Performance
-----------

* Optimize addition / subtraction / fused-multiply-add for cases where
  exponents differ wildly.

* Properties on the BinaryInterchangeFormat should be cached.


Tests
-----

* Use assertSignalsInvalidOperation where appropriate (replace older
  invalid_operation_handler(signal_list.append) mechanism.

* Convert test_scale_b to use ArithmeticTestCase machinery.

* Don't use operation.__name__.  In addition, the operation should not
  contain information about argument formats;  that's only necessary
  for parsing the test data, not for executing the operation.
