Bugs
----

* Fix nan handling: should shorten payloads when necessary.

Features
--------

* Implement short float repr.

* Add operator overloads, with suitable semantics for guessing output type.

Internal refactoring
--------------------

* Remove dependence on decimal.

* Factor out repeated rounding code.

* Be consistent about internal uses of is_finite, is_infinite versus ._type
  tests.

* Cache zeros, make use of them (format method for zeros?)


Tests
-----

* Float64 tests: random tests comparing with float.
