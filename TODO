# Implement short float repr.
# Remove dependence on decimal.
# Factor out repeated rounding code.
# Add operator overloads, with suitable semantics.
# Tests for subtraction.
# Be consistent about internal uses of is_finite, is_infinite versus ._type tests.
# Float64 tests: random tests comparing with float.
# Cache zeros, make use of them (format method for zeros?)
