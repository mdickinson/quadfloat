Bugs
----

* Lots of public methods are missing docstrings.


Documentation
-------------

* Create some!


Features
--------

* Implement short float repr.

* Fill out the rest of the IEEE 754 *required* functionality, excluding rounding modes,
  exceptions, signals.

* Implement rounding modes.

* Implement exceptions, flags, etc.

* Look at the rest of the recommended functionality (e.g., correctly-rounded
  math operations; could take some time!)


Internal refactoring
--------------------

* Remove dependence on decimal.

* Factor out repeated rounding code.

* Be consistent about internal uses of is_finite, is_infinite versus ._type
  tests.

* Cache zeros, make use of them (format method for zeros?)

* Move class methods from _BinaryBase to BinaryInterchangeFormat.


Performance
-----------

* Optimize addition / subtraction for cases where exponents differ wildly.


Tests
-----

* Float64 tests: random tests comparing with float.

* Make sure that all tests pass on Python 3.2, Python 3.3 beta, Python 2.6 and
  Python 2.7  (Python 3.1 support a nice-to-have, but not necessary.)
