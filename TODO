Bugs

Features
--------

* Implement short float repr.


Internal refactoring
--------------------

* Remove dependence on decimal.

* Factor out repeated rounding code.

* Be consistent about internal uses of is_finite, is_infinite versus ._type
  tests.

* Cache zeros, make use of them (format method for zeros?)


Tests
-----

* Float64 tests: random tests comparing with float.

* Make sure that all tests pass on Python 3.2, Python 3.3 beta, Python 2.6 and
  Python 2.7  (Python 3.1 support a nice-to-have, but not necessary.)
